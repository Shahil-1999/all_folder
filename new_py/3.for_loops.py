# Loops -  to execute a group of statements a certain number of times. This can be done using loops.
# For Loops - A for loop enables a particular set of conditions to be executed repeatedly until a condition is satisfied.

# Normal For Loops
# name = "Shahil"
# for i in name:
#     print(i, end=", ")


# Loops in List
# b = ["Shahil","Sirsha","Mujahid","Sonu"]
# for k in b:
#     print(k)



# Nested Loops
# c = ["Shahil","Sirsha","Mujahid","Sonu"]
# for l in c:
#     print(l)
#     for j in l:
#         print(j)


# Ranges - The Python range() function returns a sequence of numbers, in a given range.
for m in range(5):  # It will print 0 to 4
    print(m)


for n in range(3, 5):  # It will print 2 to 4
    print(n)

for o in range(3, 15, 2):  # It will print 3 to 15 and skip th value which is in beetwen 3 to 15, bacically first parameter is for starting value , second is ending value, nd third is skip value.
    print(o)
